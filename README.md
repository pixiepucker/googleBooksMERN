# Google Books MERN Challenge

## Description and Explanation
For our final challenge, we were to refactor an app to use Apollo and GraphQL. While following along with my online clas modules, I was able to implement some of the necessary changes, but due to outside forces I was unable to finish this challenge. 

On June 24th, the United States SCOTUS voted to overturn Roe v. Wade and plunge millions of Americans into unsafe situations. The right to healthcare and family planning was ripped away from me and so many others... so I couldn't just sit there and work on this project. Protests have broken out across the US, in cities from coast to coast and I was lucky enough to be able to attend and fight for my rights. This past week and a half have been full of panic-induced doom-scrolling and late nights researching online resources. I will list the ones I've found below, and if you or someone you know needs help accessing healthcare, don't be afraid to speak up. There are people out there who will help you.

And there was no one left,
To speak out for me" - [Neimöller,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Niem%C3%B6ller) early post-war period.
